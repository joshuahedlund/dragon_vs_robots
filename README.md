# Dragon vs. Robots

This is a simple modified "Space Invaders" style game. It is made with pygame.
It is based on the project in Eric Matthes's Python Crash Course book. Some
of the changes include:

- Horizontal instead of vertical play
- Images were replaced with AI images generated by Stable Diffusion
- A big boss that requires super bullets (extended class)
- Super bullets are placed randomly and must be collected

### How to Play

- Download the repo
- Run `python3 dragon_vs_robots.py

### Known bugs / todos

- Fleet direction does not set properly if rows are eliminated before the first direction change
- Need to indicate number of collected super bullets and boss lives left
- Need to ensure random bullets do not generate where player already is
- Replace player lives left with icon
- Catch exceptions
- Add tests
- Clean up code especially main script
